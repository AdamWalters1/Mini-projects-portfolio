# C++ Arrays and Algorithms

## Program 1 - Array Algorithm

You are tasked with creating a C++ program that performs two key functions on a list of integers: identifying prime numbers and sorting them. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Your program should be able to process a predefined array of integers, find all the prime numbers within this array, and then sort these prime numbers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

The bubble sort algorithm is a straightforward sorting technique that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted. In your implementation, special attention should be given to the efficiency and correctness of both the prime number identification and the sorting process.

Your program should consist of the following components:

1. __Prime Number Checker:__ Implement a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the integer is a prime number.
2. __Bubble Sort Algorithm:__ Implement the bubble sort algorithm in a function that takes an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order.
3. Main Program Logic: Use a standard array to store a predefined set of integers. Implement logic to iterate through this array, identify prime numbers using your prime number checker, and store these prime numbers in a separate array.
4. __Sorting and Output:__ Apply the bubble sort algorithm to the array of identified prime numbers and then output the sorted list to the console.

This program will test your understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays in C++. Additionally, it will provide practical experience with algorithms, particularly in sorting and number theory. Your program should be well-structured, efficiently coded, and should include comments for clarity and understanding. Good luck, and have fun with the challenge!
