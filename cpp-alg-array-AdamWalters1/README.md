## Program 1 - Array Algorithm

Thi program consists of the following components:

1. __Prime Number Checker:__ Implemented a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the integer is a prime number.
2. __Bubble Sort Algorithm:__ Implemented the bubble sort algorithm in a function that takes an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order.
3. Main Program Logic: Using a standard array to store a predefined set of integers. Implemented logic to iterate through this array, identify prime numbers using your prime number checker, and store these prime numbers in a separate array.
4. __Sorting and Output:__ Applying the bubble sort algorithm to the array of identified prime numbers and then output the sorted list to the console.
