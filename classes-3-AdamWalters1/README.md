# More classes in C++, `static` variables and `const`

## Bank Account

Define the class bankAccount to implement the basic properties of a bank account. An object of this class should store
the following data:

- Account holderâ€™s name (string)
- account number ( int )
- account type (string, checking/saving)
- balance ( double )
- interest rate ( double, Store interest rate as a decimal number.)

Add appropriate member functions to manipulate an object. Use a static member in the class to automatically assign
account numbers. Declare an array of 10 components of type bankAccount to process up to 10 customers and write a program
to illustrate how to use your class.

I will walk you through this.

## Tests 

The tests for this assignment are designed to evaluate the code from a strict perpsective for certain functions. 
Passing all of the tests indicates a 100, however if tests are not passed the code will be looked into.
